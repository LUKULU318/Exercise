To develop a Python-based random account generator that records the account and password details into a Google Sheet, we can break down the code into the following parts:

1. Account Generator (Python Script)
This part of the code will generate random usernames and passwords.
It will then send this data to a Google Sheets API endpoint to store the generated account details.
2. Google Sheets Integration (Google Apps Script)
Google Sheets is used as a storage for the generated accounts.
You'll use Google Apps Script to handle POST requests from the Python script and save the data to a sheet.
3. Project Structure for GitHub
Organize the repository so that each part is clearly separated into files and directories, including a README.md and other essentials.
